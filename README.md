# Space-Invaders
In this project I was trying to simulate the space invaders game in python using the pygame library.  I implemented collisions to simulate when an alien is shot and can disappear from the screen, a highscore to keep track of the current highscore, and a Boss that would appear every 10 rounds that takes 3 shots to kill and every time it gets shot it increase in speed.
